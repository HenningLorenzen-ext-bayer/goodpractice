## R CMD check results

There were 0 ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:

* checking top-level files ... NOTE
  Non-standard file/directory found at top level:
    'pkgdown'

This was added by `pkgdown::build_site()`.

## Downstream dependencies

This is a small update to get the package back on CRAN; I did not run `revdepcheck`.
